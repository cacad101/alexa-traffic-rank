Note: if some site is not register with alexa.com than may be you can get less data than listed above. some time if it does not shows listed data in output of your program, than assume that alexa does not have enough data or alexa may not have that data yet.
 
for example may be possible that you will get all data listed above except Bounce rate that means this site is new for alexa it may take some to display Baounce rate or may be this site is still not registered with alexa.com
